Okay, here's the regenerated `VISION.md` content, stripped down to just the core vision and principles, without the formal headers, signatures, or emojis, as requested.

## **Epistemology Engine: Project Vision & Guiding Principles**

### **1. The Core Problem**

We are building this system to address the challenge of transforming scattered, inconsistent, and often implicit organizational knowledge (from documents, experts, field operations) into a **reliable, structured, and continuously improving digital asset**. Traditional knowledge bases often become stagnant, untrustworthy, or difficult for both humans and AI to use effectively.

### **2. Our Vision: The "Epistemology Engine"**

We envision a system that doesn't just store information, but actively **processes, synthesizes, validates, and refines** it. It acts as an "epistemology engine" – a machine for generating and managing trustworthy knowledge. The ultimate goal is a living knowledge base that demonstrably improves operational efficiency, training effectiveness, and decision-making accuracy.

### **3. Guiding Principles (The "North Star")**

Every technical decision, feature request, or troubleshooting effort should be measured against these core principles:

* **Knowledge Retention:** The system must actively help human users learn and *remember* information effectively, using proven pedagogical techniques (like spaced repetition and active recall). **It's not just a library; it's a tutor.**
* **Metacognition:** The system must help users (and itself) understand the boundaries of its knowledge – what it knows confidently, what is uncertain, and why. **It highlights gaps, not just facts.**
* **AI-Actionable Asset:** The knowledge must be structured and represented in a way that other AI agents can reliably query, understand, and act upon. **It's not just for humans; it's an API for intelligence.**
* **Zero-Hallucination via Grounding:** All generated content (summaries, explanations, answers) *must* be demonstrably traceable back to specific, verifiable source artifacts within our own corpus. **If it can't cite it, it can't say it.**
* **Database as the Single Source of Truth:** All canonical knowledge, metadata, and state reside in the structured database (Postgres). External systems (like Notion) are *mirrors*, not masters. **Data integrity is paramount.**
* **Closed-Loop Learning (HIL):** The system must incorporate feedback from human experts and field operations (`Step 10B`) to correct errors, refine understanding, and adapt over time. **It learns from reality.**
